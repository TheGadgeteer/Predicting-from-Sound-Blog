Sampling refers to measuring the signal values in specific timestep, which produces a time-discrete signal from an time-continuous signal. Quantization means mapping the continuous signal values to discrete values in a specific range, e.g. 16 bits.\n",

However this has several disadvantages, one of them being the extensive memory usage. Loading the entire dataset into memory might exceed our capacities. A so-called data generator can provide relief. It loads the samples one by one in real-time during training and testing instead of using the naive approach of loading all samples at once. The code for such a data generator can be found at https://stanford.edu/~shervine/blog/keras-how-to-generate-data-on-the-fly. \n",
