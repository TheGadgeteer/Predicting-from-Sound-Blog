    "## Introduction\n",
    "The objective of this project is to find ways of obtaining information from sounds using neural networks. Examples of such information include the source of a sound as well as the distance of the source to the microphone.\n",
    "To approach the detection of the sound source, we are constructing a neural network based on a submission {% fn 1 %} to the [Freesound General-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/overview), a competition with the goal of classifying audio files from a wide range of real-world environments.\n",

    "As a dataset for testing and training, we are using the one provided for the 2018 Kaggle Freesound competition, which is downloadable [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/data).\n",
    "It contains sounds from 41 different categories such as trumpet or fireworks, with 9473 training examples and 1600 test examples. However the samples aren't distributed uniformly over the categories, meaning there's more data for some categories than for others. Also, the amount of manually verified samples varies from category to category.  This might cause the training to become more challenging.\n",

    "At this point we must decide in which format we will provide the network input. The dataset samples are given as raw audio data files, which could be directly used as input. However this has several disadvantages, one of them being the extensive memory usage. Loading the entire dataset into memory might exceed our capacities. A so-called data generator can provide relief. It loads the samples one by one in real-time during training and testing instead of using the naive approach of loading all samples at once. The code for such a data generator can be found at https://stanford.edu/~shervine/blog/keras-how-to-generate-data-on-the-fly. \n",
