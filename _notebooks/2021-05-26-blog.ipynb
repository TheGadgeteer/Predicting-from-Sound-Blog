    "## Introduction\n",
    "The objective of this project is to find ways of obtaining information from sounds using neural networks. Examples of such information include the source of a sound as well as the distance of the source to the microphone.\n",
    "To approach the detection of the sound source, we are constructing a neural network based on a submission to the [freesound general-purpose audio tagging challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/overview), a competition with the goal of classifying audio files from a wide range of real-world environments."

    "\n",
    "As a dataset for testing and training, we are using the one provided for the 2018 Kaggle Freesound competition, which is downloadable [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging/data).\n",
    "It contains sounds from 41 different categories such as trumpet or fireworks, with 9473 training examples and 1600 test examples. However the samples aren't distributed uniformly over the categories, meaning there's more data for some categories than for others. Also, the amount of manually verified samples varies from category to category.  This might cause the training to become more challenging.\n",
